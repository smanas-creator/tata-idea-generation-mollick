# Deploy frontend
cd frontend
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```
- ‚úÖ Free tier: Unlimited static sites
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploys from Git
- ‚úÖ Custom domains included
- ‚úÖ Zero configuration needed

**Alternative: Netlify**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Drag & drop build/ folder to netlify.com
```

### **Backend Deployment (FastAPI + Python)**
**Recommended: Railway** (best for Python)
```bash
# In your backend directory
pip freeze > requirements.txt
# Push to GitHub, connect Railway to your repo
```
- ‚úÖ Free tier: 500 hours/month
- ‚úÖ Zero-config Python deployments
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database included
- ‚úÖ Environment variable management

**Alternative: Render**
- Free tier: 750 hours/month
- Direct GitHub integration
- Good FastAPI support

### **Database Options (if needed in future)**
- **Railway**: Free PostgreSQL included
- **PlanetScale**: Free MySQL tier
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Free 512MB tier

### üîß Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Update CORS origins** in `backend/main.py`:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app",
        "http://localhost:3000"  # Keep for local development
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

2. **Environment variables for Railway/Render**:
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` in deployment dashboard
   - Add `PORT` (usually auto-configured)

3. **Update frontend Socket.IO connection**:
```typescript
const socket = io('https://your-backend-domain.railway.app', {
  path: '/socket.io/',
  transports: ['websocket']
});
```

### üìù Step-by-Step Deployment

#### Backend First (Railway):
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Create account at railway.app
3. Connect Railway to your GitHub repo
4. Add environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
5. Railway auto-detects Python and deploys
6. Note your Railway app URL

#### Frontend Second (Vercel):
1. Update Socket.IO URL in frontend code to Railway backend URL
2. Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
3. Run `vercel` from frontend directory
4. Follow prompts and deploy
5. Get your Vercel app URL

#### Final Configuration:
1. Update backend CORS to include Vercel URL
2. Test the deployed application
3. Share the Vercel URL for public testing

### üí∞ Cost Breakdown

- **Backend (Railway):** $0/month (up to 500 hours)
- **Total Monthly Cost:** $0

### üîó Live URLs Structure
- **Frontend:** `https://tata-idea-generation.vercel.app`
