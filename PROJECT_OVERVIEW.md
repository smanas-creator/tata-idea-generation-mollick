### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **First Request Cold Start**: Render's free tier spins down after inactivity. First request may take 30-60 seconds to wake up the service.

2. **Processing Time**: AI agent processing typically takes 30-60 seconds. The UI shows a loading state during this time.

3. **Deployment**: Both services auto-deploy from GitHub main branch. Push to GitHub triggers automatic redeployment.

4. **Render Logs**: Monitor backend at https://render.com/dashboard for deployment status and logs.

5. **Vercel Dashboard**: Monitor frontend at https://vercel.com/dashboard for deployment details.
