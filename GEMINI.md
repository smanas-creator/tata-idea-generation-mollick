# Project Overview

This project consists of a Python FastAPI backend and a React TypeScript frontend.

## Backend (`backend/`)
- **Purpose:** Generates ideas using `crewai` agents based on user input from the frontend.
- **Technologies:** FastAPI, Python-SocketIO, CrewAI, Langchain, OpenAI.
- **Current State:**
    - The backend server runs on `http://localhost:8000`.
    - It successfully receives idea submissions from the frontend via Socket.IO.
    - It processes these ideas using `crewai` agents and returns a final document.
    - **Known Issue:** The step-by-step output of the `crewai` agents is not being displayed in the frontend. This is due to compatibility issues with the installed `crewai` version (`0.193.2`) and its interaction with `sys.stdout` / logging mechanisms. Features like `step_callback` and `full_output` are not available in this version.
    - **Key Modifications:**
        - `backend/main.py`: Configured CORS, fixed Socket.IO connection path, handled `CrewOutput` serialization, and implemented `StreamToSocketIO` for `sys.stdout` redirection (though currently ineffective for `crewai`'s verbose output).
        - `backend/agents.py`: Changed OpenAI model from `gpt-4-turbo-preview` to `gpt-3.5-turbo` to resolve `NotFoundError`.
        - `backend/tasks.py`: Corrected agent assignment in `create_hr_tasks` from `agent_name` to `agent` objects.

## Frontend (`frontend/`)
- **Purpose:** Provides a user interface to submit ideas and display agent conversations and final documents.
- **Technologies:** React, TypeScript, Socket.IO Client.
- **Current State:**
    - The frontend development server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
    - It successfully connects to the backend via Socket.IO.
    - It sends user ideas to the backend and displays the final document received.
    - **Known Issue:** Does not display intermediate agent steps due to the backend's inability to capture and send them.
    - **Key Modifications:**
        - `frontend/src/App.tsx`: Corrected Socket.IO connection URL to include `/socket.io` path and added explicit `path` and `transports` options.

## Next Steps

**The primary next step is to address the `crewai` output issue by changing the Python version in the remote environment.**

- **Problem:** The current Python version (likely 3.13) is preventing `crewai` from upgrading to a version that supports `step_callback` or `full_output`, which are necessary to capture and display intermediate agent outputs.
- **Proposed Solution:** Downgrade the Python version in the remote environment to a more stable and widely supported version (e.g., Python 3.11 or 3.12).
- **Action Required:** The user needs to manually change the Python version in the remote environment, create a new virtual environment with the chosen Python version, and reinstall all dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`.

Once the Python version is changed and dependencies are reinstalled, we can then re-attempt to implement the `step_callback` approach in `backend/main.py` to capture and display the step-by-step agent outputs.
